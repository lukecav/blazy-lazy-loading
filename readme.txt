WordPress plugin which uses bLazy.js for lazy loading images on a site.

== Description ==

WordPress plugin which uses bLazy.js for lazy loading images on a site. bLazy is used on big sites with millions of monthly visitors so it has been tested out in the real world. bLazy is written in pure JavaScript why it doesnâ€™t depend on 3rd-party libraries such as jQuery. bLazy is lightweight, less than 1.4KB and less than 1.25KB if you don't need IE7- support. bLazy is very fast. It has focus on performance why it also auto-destroys when it's done lazy loading.
